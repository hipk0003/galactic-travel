                <h2 class="pl-head">Jakku</h2>
                <p class="pl-p">Jakku was a remote desert planet located in the Jakku system, within the Western Reaches of the galaxy's Inner Rim. Though considered by many within the galaxy to be distant and relatively worthless, Jakku was the site of important events that would shape galactic history. In 5 ABY, Jakku was the site of the pivotal Battle of Jakku, which ended the Galactic Civil War in favor of the New Republic. A generation later, the planet was the home of the scavenger Rey, who became involved in the events of the Cold War after helping the former First Order stormtrooper Finn and the astromech droid BB-8 escape offworld with a map leading to the missing Jedi Luke Skywalker.</p>

                <h2 class="pl-head">Kamino</h2>
                <p class="pl-p">Kamino (pronounced /kə'minoʊ/) was an aquatic planet located in a remote star system in the Abrion sector of the Outer Rim and was located in the outskirts of the galaxy and was considered extragalactic due to this and straggled south of the Rishi Maze irregular dwarf satellite galaxy. It was inhabited by the Kaminoans — a race of tall, elegant beings with long necks who were regarded as a mysterious species that tended to keep to themselves. They were also known for their cloning technology, which was used to create a clone army for the Galactic Republic.</p>

                <h2 class="pl-head">Mustafar</h2>
                <p class="pl-p">Mustafar was a small planet located in the Mustafar system, within the Atravis sector of the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories. Once a garden world nourished by the Bright Star artifact, its orbit was shifted when Lady Corvax unleashed the energies of the Bright Star in an attempt to return her husband to life. The resulting gravimetric duel between the gas giants Jestefad and Lefrani over Mustafar heated the planet's core, transforming the lush world into an imbalanced volcanic hellscape. Adapting to life on their devastated homeworld, the arthropodal Mustafarians evolved into two distinct subspecies that cooperated to ensure their continued survival. Legends of Corvax's search for immortality brought the ancient Sith to Mustafar, seeking the same secrets of eternal life. There, they built a temple over a locus in the dark side of the Force, above the buried ruins of Corvax Fortress.</p>

                <p class="pl-p">Bespin was a gas giant in the star system of the same name. Forming a part of the Anoat sector, its riches manifested in the form of rare tibanna gas. Attracting mining interests and remaining unaffiliated in galactic affairs, Ugnaughts were employed to extract tibanna from repulsorlifted facilities whilst Bespin's mostly human population resided in the open upper levels, exposed to a thin layer of breathable atmosphere in an area known as a "Life Zone."</p>
